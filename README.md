# 🕹️ Old Modrinth Layout

**A CSS theme that brings back the classic Modrinth look.**  
Modern Modrinth is great, but sometimes you just want that old-school layout — compact, familiar, and clean.  
This style restores the nostalgic design while keeping things compatible with current Modrinth features.

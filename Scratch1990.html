  <h1>The 1990 Scratch Prototype - "+S+"</h1>

  <p>In the shadowy past of educational programming tools lies a forgotten prototype known only to a few obscure developers and digital historians. Before the Scratch we know today, there existed a strange, unreleased program called <strong>+S+</strong>, created sometime around <strong>1990</strong> by a secret collaboration between <strong>MIT Media Lab</strong> and <strong>Disney Interactive</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Origins and Platform</h2>
  <p>+S+ was never made public. It was designed to run on <strong>Windows 3.0 through 2000</strong>, but oddly, it also works on <strong>Windows 8.1</strong> if launched from the <code>cmd</code> prompt. It refuses to run on Windows 10 or 11. It's incompatible with Windows Whistler and all Windows Server editions.</p>

  <h2>The Interface and The Shadow</h2>
  <p>+S+ didn’t have many features. Its most notable element was a bizarrely overcomplicated version of the Scratch Cat. The only known image of the program wasn’t a screenshot — it was a <em>photograph</em> taken of a computer monitor, and in the reflection of the screen, a <strong>mysterious shadow</strong> figure appears, standing just behind the person taking the photo.</p>

  <h2>Super Secret Settings</h2>
  <p>Users who tried to register at <a href="http://scratch-mit.disney.cc/create-an-account.php">scratch-mit.disney.cc</a> could access a hidden setting: by clicking the Scratch Cat icon (which glitches on hover), the actual program launches, but now the UI is corrupted. The screen fills with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Distorted images of the Scratch Cat</li>
    <li>Glitched screenshots of the early editor</li>
    <li>Real photos of the MIT Media Lab and Disney HQ</li>
    <li>Fragments of Mickey Mouse in bizarre, static-filled poses</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After viewing the images, the computer crashes and becomes unresponsive. Antivirus software identifies <code>+S+.exe</code> as malware or a virus.</p>

  <h2>The Web Links</h2>
  <p>Some remnants remain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://scratch-mit.disney.cc">scratch-mit.disney.cc</a> (only loads on Windows 95+)</li>
    <li><a href="http://scratch-mit.disney.cc/Æ.txt">Æ.txt</a> — corrupted text, possibly encrypted secrets</li>
    <li><a href="http://scratch-mit.disney.cc/program/1">Program Page 1</a> — lets you download <code>Æ.sb0</code>, a project file in a strange binary format</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Mystery of Æ</h2>
  <p>The file <code>Æ.sb0</code> is believed to be the key. Some say something dark is hidden within — possibly code fragments, or maybe an embedded recording. MIT and Disney seemed obsessed with the "Æ" character, and it appears repeatedly throughout the prototype’s file system.</p>

  <h2>The 1991 Leak</h2>
  <p>In April 1991, +S+ was accidentally made public for a brief period. A 9-year-old child downloaded it and saved it on a floppy disk. That disk, along with other hard drives and storage, was lost to time. The now 44-year-old man still owns the damaged hardware, but all attempts to recover the file have failed. Some say he still dreams about the distorted cat and static-ridden Mickey.</p>

  <h2>Forgotten Ad on Disney DX</h2>
  <p>Between 1987 and 1989, a low-budget advertisement aired briefly on Disney DX. It mentioned a "revolutionary creativity tool" for kids called <strong>+S+</strong>. No footage remains, and Disney denies ever airing it.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The 1990 Scratch Prototype remains one of the internet’s most obscure and chilling digital mysteries. Whether a hoax, a lost experiment, or something else entirely, one thing’s certain — if you ever find a copy of <code>+S+.exe</code> or the file <code>Æ.sb0</code>, run. Or… maybe open it. Just don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>
